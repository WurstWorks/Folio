# Folio Publishing Platform #

This is Folio, an open-source content management platform:

  - Its core is built on well established free and open-source frameworks
  - Runs on any server with [Java] 11 or later installed
  - Can be plugged into any standard Java application server such as [Tomcat]
  - Can use its own internal database or most common datastore platforms

The goal of WurstWorks Folio is provide a flexible, extensible, and performant publishing platform that is also open, comprehensible, and lends itself well to importing content from, exporting content to, and exchanging content with other Folio installations, as well as with other publishing installations on other platforms such as [Drupal], [WordPress], and more.
